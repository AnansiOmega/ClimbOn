Project Backend: [ClimbOnBe](https://github.com/AnansiOmega/climbOnBe)

Climb on is a Social Network application built to connect climbers. Due the nature of rock climbing being a partner sport, it may be difficult do some of your favorite climbing alone. This social network application aims to solve that problem. Featuring; Jwt Authentication, Photo uploads, Geolocation, Instant-Messenging and so much more!

The Technologies used to create this project are React/Redux, Hooks, Thunk (middleware), React-router-dom, and React ActionCable. For styling I am using Material Ui, featuring a design system created by Creative Tim.
