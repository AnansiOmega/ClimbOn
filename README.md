# ClimbOn

<h2>This Application is still under developement</h2>

Climb on is a Social Network application built to connect climbers. Due the nature of rock climbing being a partner sport, it may be difficult do some of your favorite climbing alone. This social network application aims to solve that problem. Featuring; Jwt Authentication, Photo uploads, Geolocation, Instant-Messenging and so much more!

The Technologies used to create this project are, React.js with Redux, using hooks, and Thunk Middleware. For styling I am using Material Ui, featuring a design system created by Creative Tim.

Questions, Comments, or Feedback is/are greatly appreciated!
